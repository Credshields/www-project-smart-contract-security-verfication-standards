I have worked on OWASP Smart Contract Security Top 10 [https://owasp.org/www-project-smart-contract-top-10/|https://owasp.org/www-project-smart-contract-top-10/] recently and after its completion, I want to take the project ahead by drafting Smart Contract Security Verification standards (SCSVS) taking inspiration from OWASP MASVS ([https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/|https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/]) and then SCSTG (Smart Contract Security Testing guide). Last year, blockchain-related hacks resulted in losses totaling $1.3 billion, with $700 million attributed to vulnerabilities in smart contracts. This significant gap in security standards for smart contracts underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive framework. This project is to establish such standards, enabling global collaboration and providing developers with clear guidelines to enhance security during the development process.

SCSVS usages will be as below:
1. A security standard for developers, and project owners.
2. Guideline for auditors, and testers.
3. Possibly a baseline for the codebase being (Tested/Non-Tested)

And parallelly, OWASP SCSTG (Next in the plan) will serve as a comprehensive manual for actual auditing/testing. It will describe the technical processes for verifying the controls defined in OWASP SCSVS. While SCSTG is a guide, SCS Checklist will be the actual checklist for the auditor to follow/tick-mark what controls/tests were tested; what passes, what fails, discoveries, etc. 

### Road Map
This initiative will be part of the broader OWASP Smart Contracts Security (SCS) project, which aims to provide robust guidelines and tools for securing smart contracts.

Components of OWASP Smart Contracts Security (SCS) Project

Step 1:
OWASP SCSVS: Smart Contracts Security Verification Standard - [Work In progress]

Step2:
Based on the existing SCSVS.
OWASP SCSWE: Security Weakness Enumeration [TO-DO] 

Step3:
OWASP SCSTG: Security Testing Guide [TO-DO]  Inspired by the Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG).

Note: OWASP Top-10 for Smart Contracts Top-10 Smart Contract Bugs - (We have already done it and would do it again for 2024 based on our dataset [https://solidityscan.com/web3hackhub|https://solidityscan.com/web3hackhub])
